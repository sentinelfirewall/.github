### Let's keep the awesome ConfigServer Firewall alive!

ConfigServer is widely used by developers, hosting companies, and control panels.. Keeping it healthy and updated is in everyoneâ€™s interest, and joining efforts in one central place means:

* The awesome ConfigServer Firewall keeps existing
* A shared pool of contributors instead of scattered forks
* Faster bug fixes and feature improvements
* Long-term stability that hosting providers and control panels can rely on

I have set up a neutral GitHub organization to host the community-driven fork: Sentinel - and everyone is very welcome to join, contribute, or even just use it and share feedback. ðŸ™Œ
